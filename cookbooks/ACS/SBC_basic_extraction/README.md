In this Jupyter Notebook tutorial, we present the workflow for performing a basic spectral extraction using ACS/SBC Prism full frame data with the HSTaXe software.

This directory, once cloned/downloaded, should contain this README.md, the tutorial Jupyter Notebook acs_sbc_hstaxe.ipynb, and a .HTML copy of the notebook. In the .HTML version of the notebook each cell has been run and the corresponding output is shown.
