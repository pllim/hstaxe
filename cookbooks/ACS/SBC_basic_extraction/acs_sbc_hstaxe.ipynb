The first substep (`axeprep`) computes all the transformations between the spectroscopic and direct image pixels, which is written into a fits table for faster access in later steps.  The second sub-step (`axecore`) groups various elements from the fits table as a function of wavelength, folding in aspects of the cross-dispersion profile, estimating the contamination based on other sources, and much more.   Naturally, there are many parameters that govern these actions, so we refer the reader to the [hstaxe documentation](https://hstaxe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.\n",

    "The flux between the boxcar extraction (blue) and the optimal extraction (orange; see the method of [Horne 1986](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986PASP...98..609H/abstract)) in the last figure is very minor (see left panel).  However, the optimal method should generally produce a higher signal-to-noise, as shown in the right panel.  Nevertheless, users should only expect this performance increase when the source profile is well understood and easily measured.  Because, when this is not true, one should expect systematic biases between the measured and true signal.\n",

    "### Additional Work for the Reader\n",
    "\n",
    "This work can be extended in two ways:\n",
    "1.  There are observations in PR110L as well.  This is a trivial exercise of identifying the dataset names and redoing the notebook with those files. In this case, one will require the calibration file for the PR110L prism (`ACS.SBC.PR110L.Cycle13.conf`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  There are multiple observations (at different detector positions) in both PR110L and PR130L, which were used to calibrate the field dependence of various aspects.  These data could be used to improve the S/N of the final extraction, however `hstaxe` does not provide facility to combine the spectra taken at different position angles (PAs).  Therefore, one extracts the 1d spectra at each unique PA separately and *post facto* combines them according to whatever method they wish (e.g. sigma-clipped, variance-weighted average).  However, this process can be tricky for extended sources, where the spectral resolution for differ between the PAs.  This is because the spectral resolution will depend on the \"extent\" of the galaxy projected along the dispersion axis, in analogy to the relationship between slit-width and spectral resolution in classic, slit-based spectroscopy.  Please see [Ryan, Casertano, & Pirzkal (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASP..130c4501R/abstract) for more information on techniques for combining data at multiple position angles.\n"
